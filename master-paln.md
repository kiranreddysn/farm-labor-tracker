**Master Plan: Farm Labor Tracking Web App**

## 1. App Overview & Objectives
The Farm Labor Tracking Web App will help manage on-demand farm workers, tracking shifts, wages, and payments dynamically. It replaces paper records with a flexible, detailed digital system, making it easy to log worker data, adjust wages based on skills or seasons, and generate weekly wage reports.

## 2. Target Audience
- Single user (farm owner/manager)
- Access from both desktop and mobile browsers

## 3. Core Features & Functionality
- **Worker Management:** Add, edit, and archive worker profiles (name, skills, history)
- **Shift Tracking:** Log morning, half-day, and full-day shifts with flexible time slots
- **Wage Calculation:** Dynamic wage rates based on skill, shift length, and season (e.g., higher rates during harvest)
- **Payment Tracking:** Record weekly payments, mark paid/unpaid, and track outstanding balances
- **AI-Powered Search:** Smart, natural language search to quickly find worker records, shift details, or payment history
- **Notifications:** Reminders for pending payments and worker hour milestones
- **Reports & Exports:** Generate and download weekly wage summaries as PDFs or Excel files
- **Authentication:** Google-based login for secure access

## 4. High-Level Platform Recommendation
- **No-Code Platform:** Lovable (for rapid development, easy UI building, and backend automation)
- **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, real-time updates, authentication)
- **Search & AI:** Integrate with a tool like OpenAI or Weaviate for semantic search
- **Hosting:** Managed by the no-code platform (streamlined deployment)

## 5. Conceptual Data Model
- **Worker:** ID, name, skills, hourly rates, work history
- **Shift:** Worker ID, date, type (morning/half/full), hours worked, wage rate
- **Payment:** Worker ID, week, total wages, amount paid, balance
- **Season:** Name, start/end dates, wage multiplier

## 6. User Interface Design Principles
- **Dashboard:** At-a-glance view of today’s shifts, pending payments, and reminders
- **Worker Profiles:** Detailed pages with work history, wage records, and payment status
- **Shift Calendar:** Visual calendar to log and review shifts easily
- **Search Bar:** AI-powered, predictive search to locate workers, shifts, and payments effortlessly
- **Report Page:** Filter and generate wage summaries by week, worker, or season

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Authentication:** Google login with Supabase Auth
- **Data Protection:** Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for access control

## 8. Development Phases
- **Phase 1:** Core features — worker management, shift logging, and wage calculations
- **Phase 2:** Payment tracking, reminders, and historical data views
- **Phase 3:** Report generation, exports, and UI refinements
- **Phase 4:** AI-powered search bar integration

## 9. Potential Challenges & Solutions
- **Dynamic Wage Logic:** Handle complex wage rules using Supabase functions or Lovable’s logic builder
- **Shift Overlaps:** Use database constraints or no-code validation rules to prevent conflicts
- **AI Search Accuracy:** Fine-tune search queries and indexing to ensure accurate, relevant results

## 10. Future Expansion Possibilities
- Inventory or task management
- Multi-user access for supervisors
